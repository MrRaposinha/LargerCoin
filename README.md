### **LargerCoin**

**LargerCoin** is a simple yet effective mod for ULTRAKILL that increases the size of the coins shot by the **Marksman revolver**, making them significantly easier to hit. Designed for casual players or anyone looking to master the Marksman mechanic without the need for pinpoint accuracy.
